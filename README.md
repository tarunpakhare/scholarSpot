# scholarSpot
A website to help students find most suitable Scholarships for them.
ScholarSpot is an online website to find scholarships for students. As we know, there are 
many grants and scholarships that are available to students. But hardly, people avail the 
scholarships that are available to them due to lack of awareness and knowledge. On an 
average it is found that in USA alone, 2.3-10 billion worth of scholarships are unclaimed 
each year. ScholarSpot is designed to make students aware of the scholarships available to 
them as well as help them by providing the resources to avail the scholarships if eligible. This 
bridges the gap between the students and the Scholarship body.
The website was built keeping in mind that it could help lots of students to easily find 
scholarships for which they are eligible. We have trained the model with datasets to provide 
the students only with scholarships where they have a major opportunity to obtain it based on 
their GRE score as well their CGPA. The results obtained from the website is that it helps 
students find scholarships suitable for them in a more convenient way as well as to make
people aware of these scholarships
